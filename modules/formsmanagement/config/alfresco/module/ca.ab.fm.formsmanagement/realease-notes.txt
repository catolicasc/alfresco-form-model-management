	NEW PARAMETER: useShareProxy<BOOLEAN> : If set to true (default), all of the AJAX calls used will use the share proxy to call alfresco webscripts
	NEW PARAMETER: Allow customProperties<Object>: Allows us to override title and description properties of the display form. Works good for search titles, ive used it for a replication of the Document Details
	NEW: Dynamic dropdowns are auto detected and profiles connected to profiles are auto generated based upon users choice. i.e. If your aspect has a dynamic dropdown all the functionality for parcing and deploying the correct form is done automatically.
	NEW: Cached JSON Node Properties for load values
	NEW: Caching added for profile (storing JSON profile relative to dynamic dropdown) Moving towards instancable dynamic profiles
    NEW: Store and retrieval of Node Properties using FM API
    NEW: Callbacks added to load, save and profile completed states
    NEW: Added Connect parameter so we can choose where to inject the profile forms on dynamic dropdown change
    NEW: Allow ARRAY of nodes to save (Giving a ~ separated list will save all node properties to the given nodes)
    NEW: Optional save parameter moveId<Alfresco Space UID> allows us to move a document to a location after it has been saved
	NEW: Readonly option
	NEW: Option of using own dropdown changing event by making "handler" element available before load and setting your profile at init. This will create the trigger to look for your profile setup and create the form based upon the choice. (If you choose not to just load the aspect with a dynamic dropdown)
